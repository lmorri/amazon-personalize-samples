Pricing is set by estimating throughput capacity (requests from users for personalization per second). When deploying a campaign, you set a minimum throughput per second (TPS) value. This service, like many within AWS, will automatically scale based on demand, but if latency is critical, you may want to provision ahead for larger demand. For this POC and demo, all minimum throughput thresholds are set to 1. For more information, see the [pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/).\n",

For example, if you set explorationItemAgeCutoff to 7, the items with an age over or equal to 7 days aren’t considered cold items and there is no exploration on these items. You may still see some items older than or equal to 7 days in the recommendation list because they’re relevant to the user’s interests and are of good quality even without the help of the exploration. The default value for this parameter is 30, and you can set it to any value over 0.\n",

    "We will use the explorationWeight in the \"06_Adding_New_Items_and_Updating_Model.ipynb\", so we will set the explorationWeight to 0.9, which will cause the new (cold start) items to be recommended more often."
