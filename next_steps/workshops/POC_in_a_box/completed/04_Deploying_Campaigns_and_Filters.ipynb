For this POC and demo, all minimum throughput thresholds are set to 1. For more information, see the [pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/).\n",

For example, if you set explorationItemAgeCutoff to 7, the items with an age over or equal to 7 days aren’t considered cold items and there is no exploration on these items. You may still see some items older than or equal to 7 days in the recommendation list because they’re relevant to the user’s interests and are of good quality even without the help of the exploration. The default value for this parameter is 30, and you can set it to any value over 0.\n",
